## Creating a Schema:

-   Using Schema Definition Language (SDL)
-   Programmatically Creating a Schema using language constructs

## Basic Parts:

-   Types – a construct defining a shape with fields
-   Fields – keys on a type that have a name and a value type
-   Scalars – primitive value type built into GraphQL
-   Query – type that defines how clients can access data
-   Mutation – type that defines how clients can modify or create data
