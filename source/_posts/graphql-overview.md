## What's GraphQL ?

-   A declarative query language for your API ( a spec )
-   Provide a complete and understandable description of the data in your API
-   Ask for exactly what they need and nothing more
-   Achieved by creating a strongly typed Schema for your API

### For Server Side:

-   Type Definitions
-   Resolvers
-   Query Definitions
-   Mutation Definitions

### For Client Side:

-   Queries
-   Mutations
-   Fragments

### Fit in:

-   A GraphQL server with a connected DB
-   A GraphQL server as a layer in front of many 3rd party services and connects them all with one GraphQL API
-   A hybrid approach where a GraphQL has a connected DB and also communicate with 3rd party services
